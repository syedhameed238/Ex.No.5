## Zero-Shot Prompting

Explanation:
Zero-shot prompting is the simplest form where the model is given a task directly without any examples. It relies entirely on the model‚Äôs pre-trained knowledge to 
generate a response. This approach is fast and lightweight, suitable for generalÔøæpurpose queries.

Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "Translate 'Bonjour' to English."

Prompt ‚Äì "Translate 'Bonjour' into English."

Output ‚Äì "Hello"

Another Task ‚Äì "Classify this review: 'The product arrived late and was damaged.'"

Prompt ‚Äì "Is this review positive or negative?"

Output ‚Äì "Negative"

Key Point for Slide:

Best for simple tasks where context is minimal, but performance drops in complex 
or ambiguous tasks due to lack of examples.
# üîπ 2. One-Shot Prompting
Explanation:
In one-shot prompting, the model is provided with a single example of the task 
before being asked to perform it. This helps the model align its output with the 
structure or logic of the provided example.

Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì Summarize a sentence.
Prompt ‚Äì
"Example: 'The cat climbed the tree because it was scared.' ‚Üí Summary: The cat 
was scared and climbed the tree.
Now: 'The boy ran home because it started raining.' ‚Üí Summary:"
Output ‚Äì "The boy ran home due to the rain."

Key Point for Slide:
A balance between simplicity and guidance, useful when space is limited but some 
context is needed.
 ## Few-Shot Prompting
 
Explanation:
Few-shot prompting involves giving multiple examples (2-5 typically) before 
asking the model to perform the task. This pattern helps improve accuracy and 
reliability, especially for nuanced or domain-specific tasks.

Test Scenario 1:
Task ‚Äì Sentiment classification of a sentence.
Prompt ‚Äì
"Example 1: 'I love this phone!' ‚Üí Sentiment: Positive
Example 2: 'The camera is terrible.' ‚Üí Sentiment: Negative
Example 3: 'It‚Äôs okay, not the best.' ‚Üí Sentiment: Neutral
Now: 'The delivery was late, but the item is perfect.' ‚Üí Sentiment:"
Output ‚Äì "Mixed" or "Neutral"

Test Scenario 2:
Question: If a train travels at 60 km/h and covers 120 km, how long does it take? 
Answer: 2 hours.
Question: If a baker needs 2 eggs to bake a cake, how many eggs are needed for 3 
cakes?
Answer: 6 eggs.
Question: If a person buys an item for $10 and sells it for $15, what is the profit? 
Answer: $5. 
Question: If a car travels at 80 km/h and needs to cover 240 km, how long will it 
take?
Answer: 3 hours.
Key Point for Slide:
Highly effective for structured tasks; enables better learning of tone, style, or 
format. The main limitation is token length constraints.
Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)

Explanation:
Chain-of-thought prompting asks the model to explain its reasoning step by step
before producing the final answer. This improves performance in tasks that require 
logical or mathematical reasoning.
Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "If a train leaves at 3 PM and takes 4.5 hours to reach its destination, what 
time will it arrive?"
Prompt ‚Äì
"Let‚Äôs think step by step. The train leaves at 3 PM. 4 hours from 3 PM is 7 PM. 
Half an hour more makes it 7:30 PM.
Answer:"
Output ‚Äì "7:30 PM"
Key Point for Slide:
Ideal for tasks requiring reasoning, calculations, or logic. Greatly improves 
transparency and model reliability in critical thinking problems.
Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought
Explanation:
This technique combines Chain-of-Thought with multiple generated answers, 
selecting the most frequent or consistent one. It's like asking the model multiple 
times and picking the most "voted" response.
Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "What is 23 √ó 17?"
Prompt (CoT) ‚Äì
"Break down the multiplication:
20 √ó 17 = 340
3 √ó 17 = 51
340 + 51 = 391
Answer: 391"
The model runs this reasoning several times; even if one or two versions deviate, 
the correct answer is chosen most often.
Key Point for Slide:
Boosts accuracy in logic-based tasks; however, it requires more computation and 
output handling.
ReACT Prompting (Reasoning and Acting)
Explanation:
ReACT combines reasoning with actions like searching, browsing, or tool use. It 
is useful when the model needs to interact with external tools or APIs to gather 
updated or multi-step information.
Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "What's the capital of the country hosting the 2024 Olympics?"
Prompt Logic:
Step 1: Search ‚Äú2024 Olympics host‚Äù ‚Üí France
Step 2: Capital of France ‚Üí Paris
Answer: "Paris"
Key Point for Slide:
Great for real-time or multi-hop question answering. Requires integration with 
tools or plug-ins.
Role-Based Prompting
Explanation:
Role-based prompting assigns a persona or identity to the model (e.g., doctor, 
teacher, interviewer). This helps guide the tone, style, and domain-specific 
knowledge of the output.
Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "Explain black holes to a child."
Prompt ‚Äì "You are a science teacher talking to a 10-year-old. Explain what a black 
hole is."
Output:
"A black hole is like a super-powerful vacuum in space that sucks in everything 
near it‚Äîeven light!"
Key Point for Slide:
Effective for tone control and audience targeting. Useful in education, customer 
support, storytelling, etc.
Instruction-Based Prompting
Explanation:
In this type, the model is given explicit, natural-language instructions. It focuses 
on clarity and specificity of the task instead of examples.
Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "Rewrite this sentence to be more formal: 'Can you send this to me fast?'"
Prompt ‚Äì "Rewrite the following sentence in a more formal tone: 'Can you send 
this to me fast?'"
Output:
"Could you please send this to me as soon as possible?"
Key Point for Slide:
Highly intuitive; works well across diverse tasks like summarization, translation, 
rewriting, etc.
Tree-of-Thought Prompting (ToT)
Explanation:
ToT prompting allows the model to explore multiple paths or thoughts 
simultaneously, much like a decision tree. Each branch is a different reasoning 
path, and the best one is chosen.
Test Scenario:
Task ‚Äì "How to spend ‚Çπ1000 wisely as a student?"
Prompt:
Thought Path 1: Spend ‚Çπ500 on books, ‚Çπ300 on savings, ‚Çπ200 on food
Thought Path 2: Spend ‚Çπ300 on courses, ‚Çπ500 on travel, ‚Çπ200 on entertainment
Thought Path 3: Save ‚Çπ700, spend ‚Çπ300 on essentials
‚Üí Choose the most logical and balanced plan.
Key Point for Slide:
Best for decision-making, planning, or multi-goal reasoning. It‚Äôs complex but 
mimics human deliberation.
Test Scenario 1 (Multi-Step Arithmetic):
ÔÇ∑ Prompt: "A store sells apples for $2 each and bananas for $1.50 each. If 
someone buys 3 apples and 2 bananas, what is the total cost? Let's think 
step by step:"
ÔÇ∑ Expected Outcome: "Cost of apples: 3 * $2 = $6. Cost of bananas: 2 * $1.50 
= $3. Total cost: $6 + $3 = $9. The total cost is $9."
¬∑ Test Scenario 2 (Logical Deduction):
ÔÇ∑ Prompt: "If John is taller than Mary, and Mary is taller than Peter, who is 
the tallest? Let's think step by step:"
ÔÇ∑ Expected Outcome: "John is taller than Mary. Mary is taller than Peter. 
Therefore, John is taller than both Mary and Peter. The tallest person is 
John."
Analysis: CoT prompting can dramatically improve the accuracy of models on 
complex reasoning tasks by forcing them to articulate their thought process. This 
also makes the model's reasoning more transparent and easier to debug. However, 
crafting effective "Let's think step by step" prompts can require careful 
consideration.
Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting:
ÔÇ∑ Explanation: ToT extends CoT by allowing the model to explore multiple 
reasoning paths at each step. Instead of a linear chain, the model can 
generate several potential next steps, evaluate them, and then branch out 
from the most promising ones. This enables more robust exploration of the 
problem space.
ÔÇ∑ Pattern (Conceptual): Involves prompting the model to: 
1. Generate multiple thoughts (potential next steps).
   
3. Evaluate these thoughts based on a defined criterion (e.g., 
relevance, progress towards the goal)

4. Select the most promising thoughts to continue exploring.
   
5. Repeat the process until a solution is found.
   
Test Scenario (Complex Planning/Decision Making - Requires more advanced 
implementation): Imagine a task like "Plan a 3-day trip to Paris with a budget of 
$500, including sightseeing and food." A ToT approach would involve the model: 

ÔÇ∑ Generating multiple initial ideas for activities and budget allocation.

ÔÇ∑ Evaluating these ideas based on feasibility and budget constraints.

ÔÇ∑ Exploring promising combinations of activities and accommodations.

ÔÇ∑ Refining the plan through iterative evaluation and branching.

Analysis: 
ToT has the potential to significantly enhance the model's ability to tackle complex, open-ended problems requiring exploration and backtracking. However, implementing ToT prompting effectively often requires more 
sophisticated control mechanisms and evaluation strategies.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
ÔÇ∑ Explanation: RAG combines the power of pre-trained language models with 
the ability to access and incorporate information from external knowledge 
sources (e.g., a database, documents). The prompt includes a query that 
retrieves relevant information, and this retrieved context is then used to 
inform the model's response.
ÔÇ∑ Pattern:
1. User Query: [Question]
   
3. Retrieval: Use the query to fetch relevant documents/information.

5. Augmented Prompt: [Retrieved Context] Based on this information,answer the question: [Question]
   
ÔÇ∑ Test Scenario 1 (Answering Questions with Specific Documents):

o External Document: "The company's revenue increased by 15% in 
the last quarter, reaching $10 million."

o Prompt: "According to the provided document, what was the 
company's revenue increase in the last quarter?"

o Expected Outcome: "According to the provided document, the 
company's revenue increased by 15% in the last quarter."

ÔÇ∑ Test Scenario 2 (Generating Contextualized Responses):
o Knowledge Base (about a product): "Product X has a 10-inch screen 
and a 12-hour battery life."

o Prompt: "Describe the key features of Product X."
o Expected Outcome: "Based on the available information, Product X 
has a 10-inch screen and a 12-hour battery life."

ÔÇ∑ Analysis: 
RAG is highly effective for tasks requiring access to up-to-date or 
domain-specific information that the base model might not have. It 
improves the factual accuracy and relevance of the generated responses. 
The quality of the retrieved information is crucial for the success of RAG.
Aspect-Specific Prompting:

ÔÇ∑ Explanation: This technique focuses on guiding the model to address 
specific aspects or dimensions of a topic in a structured way. The prompt 
explicitly asks for information related to different facets of the subject.
ÔÇ∑ Pattern: "Discuss [Topic] by addressing the following aspects: [Aspect 1], 
[Aspect 2], [Aspect 3], ..."

ÔÇ∑ Test Scenario (Product Review Generation):
ÔÇ∑ Prompt: "Write a review for a new smartphone by addressing the following 
aspects: Design, Performance, Camera, and Battery Life."

ÔÇ∑ Expected Outcome: A review that systematically covers each of the 
specified aspects, providing details and opinions on each.

¬∑ Analysis: Aspect-specific prompting helps ensure that the generated response is 
comprehensive and covers all the required dimensions of the topic. It provides a 
clear structure for the model to follow.
Role-Playing Prompting:
ÔÇ∑ Explanation: This involves instructing the model to adopt a specific persona 
or role while generating the response. This can influence the style, tone, 
and content of the output.
ÔÇ∑ Pattern: "You are a [Role]. Answer the following question: [Question]"

ÔÇ∑ Test Scenario (Explaining a Concept):

o Prompt: "You are a friendly and enthusiastic science teacher. Explain the concept of photosynthesis."

o Expected Outcome: An explanation of photosynthesis that is easy to understand, engaging, and reflects the persona of a friendly science teacher.

ÔÇ∑ Analysis:

 Role-playing can be useful for creative writing, generating different perspectives, or making explanations more relatable. The effectiveness depends on how well the model can embody the given role.
Choosing the Right Prompting Pattern:

The best prompting pattern depends heavily on the specific task and the capabilities of the language model you are using.

ÔÇ∑ For simple, well-known facts, zero-shot might suffice.

ÔÇ∑ When you need a specific format or style, few-shot prompting can be very effective.

ÔÇ∑ For complex reasoning, chain-of-thought or tree-of-thoughts can significantly improve accuracy.

ÔÇ∑ When dealing with information outside the model's training data, retrievalÔøæaugmented generation is crucial.

ÔÇ∑ To ensure comprehensive coverage of a topic, aspect-specific prompting is helpful.

ÔÇ∑ For creative tasks or generating responses with a particular tone, roleÔøæplaying can be beneficial.
Experimenting with different prompting patterns and carefully analyzing the 
results is essential to discover the most effective approach for your specific use 
case. Remember that prompt engineering is an iterative process!

## Conclusion:
The landscape of prompting patterns for large language models is rich and 
continues to evolve. Each technique‚Äîfrom the simplicity of zero-shot to the 
sophisticated reasoning of chain-of-thought and tree-of-thoughts, the knowledge 
integration of RAG, the structured approach of aspect-specific prompting, and the 
stylistic influence of role-playing‚Äîoffers unique advantages and trade-offs.
The choice of the most suitable prompting pattern is not one-size-fits-all. It hinges 
on the specific task at hand, the desired output format and style, the complexity
